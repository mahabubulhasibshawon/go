# ðŸ§© Slice Playground (Go CLI Tool)

A simple command-line playground to practice slice operations in Go.  
This tool is perfect for beginners who want to understand how slices work under the hood.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Append elements to a slice
- âœ… Remove elements by index
- âœ… Reverse the entire slice
- âœ… Search for a specific element
- âœ… View current state of the slice

---

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go installed (version 1.16+ recommended)

### Run the app

```bash
go run main.go
```

---

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Output

## ðŸ“š Concepts Practiced

- Slice operations (`append`, slicing, index access)
- Buffered input using `bufio.NewReader`
- Basic CLI menus
- String and integer conversion
- Error handling

---

## ðŸ¤” Why use `bufio`?

We use `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` to read full lines of input (including spaces) from the user. It more flexible than `fmt.Scan` and handles user input in a cleaner way.

## ðŸ§  Next Steps (Optional Ideas)

- Add save/load functionality using files
- Add support for other slice types (e.g. strings)
- Build a web version using Gin or Fiber
- Create unit tests for each function
